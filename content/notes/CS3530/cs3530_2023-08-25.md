## HTTP Request Message Types

### HTTP POST

1. Web page often includes form input.
2. User input sent from client to server in entity body of HTTP POST request.

### HTTP GET

1. Include user data in URL field of HTTP GET request message, following a `?`.

### HTTP HEAD

1. Requests headers that would be returned if specified URL was requested with HTTP GET.

### HTTP PUT

1. Uploads new object to server.
2. Completely replaces object at the URL with content in entity body of POST HTTP request message.

## HTTP Response Message

Contains the following:
1. Status line
    - Protocol
    - Status code
    - Status phrase
2. Header lines
    - Date
    - Server
    - Last-Modified
    - Content-Length
    - Content-Type
3. Data

### HTTP status codes

Appears in first line in server-to-client response message. Some examples are:

1. `200 OK`: Request succeeded. Object later on in message.
2. `301 Moved Permanently`: Requested object moved. New location specified later in the message, in `Location`.
3. `400 Bad Request`: Request message not understood by server.
4. `404 Not Found`: Requested document not found on server.
5. `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`

## Cookies

1. HTTP GET responses are _stateless_.
2. No notion of multi-step exchanges of HTTP messages to complete a Web "transaction".
3. Websites and client browsers use **cookies** to maintain some state between transactions.
4. Cookies have four components:
    - Cookie header line of HTTP _response_ message
    - Cookie header line in next HTTP _request_ messages
    - Cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
    - Backend database at website
5. Use cases of cookies:
    - Authorization
    - Shopping carts
    - Recommendations
    - User session state (as in e-mail)
6. How to keep state in cookies?
    - _Protocol endpoints_. Used currently. Maintain state at sender/receiver over multiple transactions.
    - _Messages_. Cookies carry state in HTTP messages.
7. **Note**: Cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you. Third-party persistent cookies allow user to be tracked accross multiple websites.
