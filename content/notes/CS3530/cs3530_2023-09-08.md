## Socket Programming With UDP and TCP

1. **Goal**: Build client/server applications that communicate using sockets.

2. **Socket**: Door between application process and end-to-end transport protocol.

3. Two socket types:
    * **UDP**: Unreliable
    * **TCP**: Reliable, bytestream oriented.

### Socket Programming With UDP

1. No connection/handshake between client and server.
2. Sender attaches destination IP and port number explicitly to the packet.
3. Receiver extracts sender IP and port number from packet.
4. Transmitted data may be received out-of-order in UDP.

### Socket Programming With TCP

1. Client must contact server.
    * Server must be running.
    * Server must create socket to accept client contact.

2. Client contacts server.
    * Creates TCP socket, speicfies IP address and port number of server process.
    * Client TCP establishes connection to server TCP.

3. Server create new socket for server process to communicate with that client.
    * Server can talk to multiple clients.
    * Clients distinguished by port numbers.

4. No need to keep sending destination IP and port number once connection is established for client.

5. On server side, two sockets present.
    * Welcoming socket.
    * Client socket (this will be closed when transaction ends).
