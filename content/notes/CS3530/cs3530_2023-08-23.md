## Process Communicating

1. **Process** is a program running within a host.
2. Within same host, processes communicate using Inter-process Communication (IPC).
3. Across different hosts, processes communicate using _messages_.
    - **Client process**: process that initiates contact.
    - **Server process**: process that waits to be contacted.

## Socket

1. Process sends/receives messages to/from its **socket**.
2. OS controls transport layer and below, puts messages in the socket to be read by application process and vice versa. 
    - The transport layer sends these messages to another host.
3. Two sockets needed, one on each side.

## Addressing Process

1. To receive messages, process must have **identifier**.
2. **Note**: IP address of host running the process does not suffice for identifying the process, since many processes can be running on the same host.
3. **Identifier** includes _IP address_ and _port numbers_. Each port number is associated with a process on host.

## What an Application-layer Protocol Defines

1. Types of messages exchanged (request, response).
2. Message syntax (fileds in messages, and how fields are delimited).
3. Message semantics (meaning of information in fields).
4. Rules for when and how processes send/respond to messages.
5. Examples of open application protocols include HTTP, SMTP.
    - Defined in RFCs.
    - Everyone has access to protocol definition.
    - Allows for interoperability.
6. Some proprietary protocols are Skype, Zoom.

## Transport Services Required by Applications

1. Data integrity.
    - 100 percent reliable transfer, for instance in file transfer apps, web transactions.
    - Other apps (such as audio streaming) can tolerate some loss.

2. Timing
    - Apps such as interactive games require low delay to be "effective".
    - Examples of time-sensitive apps are real-time/streaming audio/video, interacitve games.
    - Examples of time-insensitive apps are file transfer/downloads, e-mail, web documents, etc.

3. Throughput
    - Multimedia apps require minimum amount of throughput to be "effective". Examples are real-time audio/video, interactive games, etc.
    - Other _elastic_ apps make use of whatever throughput is avaiable. Examples are file download, email, web documents, text messaging.

4. Security
    - Encryption, data integrity, etc.

# Internet Transport Protocols Services

## Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
1. **Reliable transport** between sending and receiving process.
2. **Flow control**: sender will not overwhelm receiver.
3. **Congestion Control**: throttle sender when network overloaded.
4. **Connection Oriented**: Setup required betwee client and server processes.
5. Does NOT provide timing, minimum throughput guarantee and security.
    - becuase of packet switching nature.

## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
1. **Unreliable data transfer** between sending and receiving processes.
2. Does NOT procide reliability, congestion/flow control, timing, throughput guarantee, security or connection setup.
3. DNS protocol uses UDP.

## Securing TCP
1. Vanilla TCP/UDP sockets:
    - no encryption.
    - cleartext sent into socket transferred plain.

2. TLS (Transport Layer Security)
    - cleartext sent as encrypted text.

# Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

## Web and HTTP

1. Web page consists of **objects**, each of which can be stored in different servers.
2. Object can be HTML file, JPEG image, audio files.
3. Webpage consists of _base HTML file_ which includes several referenced objects, each addressable by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

## HTTP Overview

1. HTTP follows a client-server model.
    - **Client** is a browser that receivers and displays web objects.
    - **Server** sends objects in response to client requests using HTTP.
2. HTTP uses TCP:
    - Client initiates TCP connection to server on port 80.
    - Server accepts TCP connection from client.
    - HTTP messages exchanged between client and server.
    - TCP connection closed after message exchange completed.
3. HTTP is _stateless_, server maintains no information about past client requests.

## HTTP Connections

1. Non-persistent HTTP:
    - TCP opened.
    - At most one obejct sent.
    - TCP closed.
    - Downloading multiple objects required multiple connections.
    - Response Time: measured in RTT (or)

2. Persistent HTTP:
    - TCP opened.
    - Multiple obejcts sent.
    - TCP closed.

## Non-persistent HTTP: Response Time
1. **RTT**: time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back.
2. Per object:
    - One RTT to initiate TCP connection.
    - One more RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes for HTTP response to return.
    - Object/file transmission time.
3. Issues:
    - 2 RTTs per object.
    - OS overhead for each TCP connection.
    - Browser opens multiple parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects in parallel.

## Persistent HTTP (1.1)
1. Server leaves connection open after sending response.
2. Subsequent HTTP messages sent over same connection.

## HTTP Request Message
1. Two types: _request_, _response_.
2. HTTP request message:
    - ASCII (human-readable format)
    - Request line: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n`
    - Header lines: include host, user-agent, connection, language, etc.
    - `\r\n` at end of header lines indicates end of header section.
