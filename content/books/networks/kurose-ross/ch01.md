## Review Questions

### Section 1.1

1. There are **no** differences between hosts and end systems. Some types of end systems are laptops, mobiles, tablets and PCs. A Web server is also an end system.

2. [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)) defines a diplomatic protocol as follows.

    > A protocol is a rule which describes how an activity should be performed, especially in the field of diplomacy.

3. Standards are important for protocols so that everyone using that protocol can create services and products using this protocol that are interoperable.

### Section 1.2

4. Four types of access networks along with their types are given below.

    | Type | Examples |
    | :- | :- |
    | Home access | DSL, Cable |
    | Enterprise access | LAN |
    | Wireless access | Cellular |

5. HFC transmission rate is shared among users. In the downstream channel, since all packets are coming from the CO, there will be _no_ collisions in the downstream channel.

6. The access technologies, speeds and prices per month are given below.

    | Access Technology | Upstream (Mbps) | Downstream (Mbps) | Rate (INR per month) |
    |:-|:-|:-|:-|
    | Cable | 100 | 15 | 800 |
    | Fiber Optic | 250 | 250 | 1000 |
    | DSL | 50 | 10 | 400 |

7. Ethernet LAN has transmission rates of 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps

8. Ethernet can run over twisted pair copper wire, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable.

9. The required details are captured in the table below.

    | Access Technology | Upstream (Mbps) | Downstream (Mbps) | Sharing |
    |:-|:-|:-|:-|
    | HFC | 30 Mbps - 100 Mbps | 40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbps | Shared |
    | DSL | 3.5 Mbps - 16 Mbps | 24 Mbps - 52 Mbps | Shared |
    | FTTH | 100 Mbps - 40 Gbps | 100 Mbps - 40 Gbps | Dedicated |

10. The most popular wireless internet technologies are WiFi and cellular access. These are compared below.

    | Parameter | WiFi | Cellular |
    |:-|:-|:-|
    | **Standard** | IEEE 802.11 | 3G/4G/5G |
    | **Range** | Few metres | Upto 10 kilometres |
    | **Cost** | Cheaper | Expensive |
    | **Speed** | Upto Gbps | Upto 45 Mbps |

### Section 1.3

11. Since we are ignoring all other sources of delay, we simply add all transmission delays at each link (except the target) for a total delay of

\begin{equation}
d = \frac{L}{R\_1} + \frac{L}{R\_2}
\label{eq:ch01-r11-1}
\end{equation}

12. A circuit-switched network is reliable and guarantees a throughput for the entire duration of communication, unlike packet-switched networks.

    TDM can carry more signals over a given frequency band and is more efficient than FDM. TDM is also suitable for communicating digital signals while FDM is not.

13. a. If circuit switching is used, then the number of users supported is
    \begin{equation}
    N = \frac{R}{r} = 2
    \label{eq:ch01-r13-1}
    \end{equation}
    where \\(R\\) is the transmission rate of the shared link and \\(r\\) is the transmission rate of each user.

    b. For queueing delays to occur, the inbound rate of packets must be larger than the transmission rate of the link. This only happens when \\(M\\) users are transmitting at the same time, where
    \begin{equation}
    Mr > R \implies M > R/r = 2.
    \label{eq:ch01-r13-2}
    \end{equation}
    Hence, there will be essentially no queueing delay if there are less than two users active at the same time and there will be a queuing delay when three users transmit at the same time.

    c. The probability that a user is transmitting is \\(p = 0.2\\).

    d. Suppose \\(Y\\) is a random variable denoting the number of active users at any time. By the given parameters,
    \begin{equation}
    Y \sim \textrm{Bin}\brak{n, p}
    \label{eq:ch01-r13-3}
    \end{equation}
    where \\(n = 3\\) and \\(p = 0.2\\). Thus,
    \begin{equation}
    \pr{Y=3} = p^3 = 8 \times 10^{-3},
    \label{eq:ch01-r13-4}
    \end{equation}
    or in other words, the queue grows for 0.8 % of the time.

14. Two ISPs at the same level of hierarchy will peer with each other for mutual benefit of faster connectivity by bypassing ISPs in the upper hierarchy and therefore potentially reducing the number of hops.

    When ISPs apply to peer at an IXP, the IXP collects a fee for this process. IXPs can also earn money by hosting data in their own datacenters.

15. Google's network is called a **content distribution network (CDN)**. It consists of multiple datacenter servers distributed at different locations, connected through dedicated links. Content providers create these networks to distribute their content more effectively to a wider area, without relying entirely on existing connections. They may also create such CDNs due to security and copyright reasons of the content hosted on these servers.

### Section 1.4

16. Components of end-to-end delay and their variability are described below.

    | Delay Component | Variability |
    |:-|:-|
    | Processing Delay | Constant |
    | Queuing Delay | Variable |
    | Transmission Delay | Constant |
    | Propagation Delay | Constant |

17. For link 2, the transmission delay is given by
\begin{equation}
d\_{\textrm{trans}} = \frac{L}{R\_2} = \frac{12 \times 10^3}{1000 \times 2^{20}}\text{ s} \approx 12\ \mu\text{s}
\label{eq:ch01-r17-1}
\end{equation}
and propagation delay is given by
\begin{equation}
d\_{\textrm{prop}} = \frac{d\_2}{c} = \frac{5 \times 10^5}{3 \times 10^8}\text{ s} \approx 1.67\text{ ms}.
\label{eq:ch01-r17-2}
\end{equation}
Thus, in link 2, the sender finishes transmitting before the first bit of the packet reaches the receiver.


    For link 3, the transmission delay is given by
\begin{equation}
d\_{\textrm{trans}} = \frac{L}{R\_3} = \frac{12 \times 10^3}{10 \times 2^{20}}\text{ s} \approx 1.2\text{ ms},
\label{eq:ch01-r17-3}
\end{equation}
and propagation delay is given by
\begin{equation}
d\_{\textrm{prop}} = \frac{d\_3}{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8}\text{ s} \approx 30\ \mu\text{s}.
\label{eq:ch01-r17-4}
\end{equation}
Thus, in link 3, the first bit of the packet reaches the receiver before the sender finishes transmitting.

18. For the general case, we see that the time taken by the packet to propagate,
\begin{equation}
d\_{\textrm{total}} = d\_{\textrm{trans}} + d\_{\textrm{prop}} = \frac{L}{R} + \frac{d}{s}.
\label{eq:ch01-r18-1}
\end{equation}
Here, delay is directly proportional to packet length and inversely proportional to transmission rate.

    We are given the following parameters
    | Parameter | Value |
    |:-|:-|
    | \\(L\\) | \\(1000 \textrm{ bits}\\) |
    | \\(R\\) | \\(2 \textrm{ Mbps}\\) |
    | \\(d\\) | \\(2500 \textrm{ km}\\) |
    | \\(s\\) | \\(2.5 \times 10^8 \textrm{ ms}^{-1}\\) |

    Substituting into \eqref{eq:ch01-r18-1}, we get \\(d = 10.48 \textrm{ ms}\\).

19. a. The throughput is
\begin{equation}
R = \min\brak{R\_1, R\_2, R\_3} = 500 \text{ kbps}.
\label{eq:ch01-r19-1}
\end{equation}
b. The time taken to complete the transfer is
\begin{equation}
t = \frac{4\times 8\times 10^6}{500 \times 2^{10}} \approx 62.5\text{ s}.
\label{eq:ch01-r19-2}
\end{equation}
c. The new throughput will be
\begin{equation}
R' = \min\brak{R\_1', R\_2', R\_3'} = 100 \text{ kbps} = \frac{R}{5}.
\label{eq:ch01-r19-3}
\end{equation}
and therefore the total time is
\begin{equation}
t' = 5t = 312.5\text{ s}.
\label{eq:ch01-r19-4}
\end{equation}

20. End system A divides the file into chunks of data called packets. Each packet has its own metadata which contains the destination of the packet, among other userful information. The packet headers are used by a router to determine the link onto which the packet is forwarded. This is analogus to asking directions at each junction en route to the destination.

21. The maximum emission rate is 500 packets per second and the minimum transmission rate is 350 packets per second. Thus, the maximum traffic intensity is
\begin{equation}
I\_{\text{max}} = \frac{500}{350} = \frac{10}{7}.
\label{eq:ch01-r21-1}
\end{equation}
Packet loss occurs after about 8.3 seconds in the first iteration and after about 9.6 seconds in the second iteration. This is because the inter-arrival times are randomly chosen.

### Section 1.5

22. A layer can perform the following tasks.
    1. Split data into packets to send to the target.
    2. Use services of the layer below it to implement its own services.
    3. Add its own metadata to the packet before passing it to the lower layer.
    4. Ensure that the packet reaches its destination reliably.
    5. Determine the route a packet should take from the sender.

    The transport and the link layer both replicate the function of reliable transfer, but on different scales (end-to-end and node-to-node).
