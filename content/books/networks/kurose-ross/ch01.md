## Review Questions

### Section 1.1

1. There are **no** differences between hosts and end systems. Some types of end systems are laptops, mobiles, tablets and PCs. A Web server is also an end system.

2. [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)) defines a diplomatic protocol as follows.

    > A protocol is a rule which describes how an activity should be performed, especially in the field of diplomacy.

3. Standards are important for protocols so that everyone using that protocol can create services and products using this protocol that are interoperable.

### Section 1.2

4. Four types of access networks along with their types are given below.

| Type | Examples |
| :- | :- |
| Home access | DSL, Cable |
| Enterprise access | LAN |
| Wireless access | Cellular |

5. HFC transmission rate is shared among users. In the downstream channel, since all packets are coming from the CO, there will be _no_ collisions in the downstream channel.

6. The access technologies, speeds and prices per month are given below.

| Access Technology | Upstream (Mbps) | Downstream (Mbps) | Rate (INR per month) |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Cable | 100 | 15 | 800 |
| Fiber Optic | 250 | 250 | 1000 |
| DSL | 50 | 10 | 400 |

7. Ethernet LAN has transmission rates of 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps

8. Ethernet can run over twisted pair copper wire, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable.

9. The required details are captured in the table below.

| Access Technology | Upstream (Mbps) | Downstream (Mbps) | Sharing |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| HFC | 30 Mbps - 100 Mbps | 40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbps | Shared |
| DSL | 3.5 Mbps - 16 Mbps | 24 Mbps - 52 Mbps | Shared |
| FTTH | 100 Mbps - 40 Gbps | 100 Mbps - 40 Gbps | Dedicated |

10. The most popular wireless internet technologies are WiFi and cellular access. These are compared below.

| Parameter | WiFi | Cellular |
|:-|:-|:-|
| **Standard** | IEEE 802.11 | 3G/4G/5G |
| **Range** | Few metres | Upto 10 kilometres |
| **Cost** | Cheaper | Expensive |
| **Speed** | Upto Gbps | Upto 45 Mbps |

### Section 1.3

11. Since we are ignoring all other sources of delay, we simply add all transmission delays at each link (except the target) for a total delay of

\begin{equation}
d = \frac{L}{R\_1} + \frac{L}{R\_2}
\label{eq:ch1-r11-1}
\end{equation}

12. A circuit-switched network is reliable and guarantees a throughput for the entire duration of communication, unlike packet-switched networks.

    TDM can carry more signals over a given frequency band and is more efficient than FDM. TDM is also suitable for communicating digital signals while FDM is not.

13. a. If circuit switching is used, then the number of users supported is
    \begin{equation}
    N = \frac{R}{r} = 2
    \label{eq:ch1-r13-1}
    \end{equation}
    where \\(R\\) is the transmission rate of the shared link and \\(r\\) is the transmission rate of each user.

    b. For queueing delays to occur, the inbound rate of packets must be larger than the transmission rate of the link. This only happens when \\(M\\) users are transmitting at the same time, where
    \begin{equation}
    Mr > R \implies M > R/r = 2.
    \label{eq:ch1-r13-2}
    \end{equation}
    Hence, there will be essentially no queueing delay if there are less than two users active at the same time and there will be a queuing delay when three users transmit at the same time.

    c. The probability that a user is transmitting is \\(p = 0.2\\).

    d. Suppose \\(Y\\) is a random variable denoting the number of active users at any time. By the given parameters,
    \begin{equation}
    Y \sim \textrm{Bin}\brak{n, p}
    \label{eq:ch1-r13-3}
    \end{equation}
    where \\(n = 3\\) and \\(p = 0.2\\). Thus,
    \begin{equation}
    \pr{Y=3} = p^3 = 8 \times 10^{-3},
    \label{eq:ch1-r13-4}
    \end{equation}
    or in other words, the queue grows for 0.8 % of the time.

14. Two ISPs at the same level of hierarchy will peer with each other for mutual benefit of faster connectivity
