1. 1. Here is a leftmost derivation to construct \\(\texttt{aa+a\*}\\).
\begin{equation}
S \rightarrow SS\texttt{\*} \rightarrow SS\texttt{+}S\texttt{\*} \rightarrow \texttt{a}S\texttt{+}S\texttt{*} \rightarrow \texttt{aa+}S\texttt{\*} \rightarrow \texttt{aa+a\*}
\label{eq:ex020201-01}
\end{equation}
    2. The parse tree is below.

    child {node {\(S\)}
        child {node {\(S\)}
            child {node {\(\texttt{a}\)}}
        }
        child {node {\(S\)}
            child {node {\(\texttt{a}\)}}
        }
        child {node {\(\texttt{+}\)}}
    }

        child {node {\(\texttt{a}\)}}
    }

    3. This grammar generates the set of all postfix expressions using operators \\(\texttt{+}\\) and \\(\texttt{*}\\). We prove this be induction on the length of the expression generated, call it \\(n\\).
        
        For \\(n = 1\\), we have \\(S \rightarrow \texttt{a}\\), which is the only postfix expression. Suppose the claim holds for all postfix expressions upto length \\(n = 2k - 1\\), where \\(k \in \mathbb{N}\\).
        Then, any \\(2k+1\\) length postfix expression takes the form \\(S\_1S\_2\sbrak{\texttt{+\*}}\\), where \\(S\_1\\) and \\(S\_2\\) are postfix expressions of length at most \\(2k-1\\). Thus, we have
        \begin{equation} 
        S \yld SS\texttt{+}\ |\ SS\texttt{-} \drv S\_1S\_2\texttt{+}\ |\ S\_1S\_2\texttt{*}.
        \label{eq:ex020201-02}
        \end{equation}
        This proves\begin{exercise}\label{ex:020202}

2. 1. We prove that the language generated is \\(\cbrak{0^n1^n\ |\ n > 0}\\) by induction on \\(n\\). For \\(n = 1\\), we see that \\(S \yld 01\\). Suppose \\(S \drv 0^k1^k\\) for some \\(k \in \mathbb{N}\\). Then, we have
    \begin{equation}
        S \yld 0S1 \yld 00^k1^k1 = 0^{k+1}1^{k+1}
        \label{eq:ex020202-01}
    \end{equation}
    which proves the claim.

    2. Similar to the previous problem, the given grammar generates all prefix expressions containing only the \texttt{+} and \texttt{-} operands.

    3. This grammar generates all balanced bracketing sequences containing only parentheses. We show this by using the definition. Clearly, we see that \\(S \yld \epsilon\\), so the base case holds. Now, suppose that \\(x\\) is a balanced bracketing sequence in this language. Then, we also see that
    \begin{equation}
        S \yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S 
        \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)} \drv \texttt{(}x\texttt{)}
        \label{eq:ex020202-02}
    \end{equation}
    or \\(\texttt{(}x\texttt{)}\\) is also in this language. Suppose also that \\(x = \texttt{(}x'\texttt{)}\\) and \\(y = \texttt{(}y'\texttt{)}\\) are balanced bracketing sequences in this language without loss of generality. Then,
    \begin{equation}
        S \yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S
        \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S
        \drv \texttt{(}x'\texttt{)(}y'\texttt{)} = \textit{xy}. 
        \label{eq:ex020202-03}
    \end{equation}
    which proves the claim. Note that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not in the required form, then we can apply the above derivation multiple times as needed to get the required form.

    4. This grammar generates all strings with equal occurrences of \\(\texttt{a}\\) and \\(\texttt{b}\\) (including the empty string). This is because, in any rule, whenever an \\(\texttt{a}\\) is added, a \\(\texttt{b}\\) is also added.

    5. This grammar generates regular expressions of \\(\texttt{a}\\), the 
    union and star operations and parentheses. We prove this claim by the 
    definition of regular expressions. Clearly, \\(S \yld \texttt{a}\\) is in 
    this language. If any regular expressions \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) are in this language, then
    \begin{align}
        S &\yld \brak{S} \drv \brak{R} \\\\
        S &\yld S^{\ *} \drv R^{\ *} \\\\
        S &\yld S\ \texttt{+}\ S \drv R\ \texttt{+}\ T \\\\
        S &\yld SS \drv RT,
        \label{eq:020202-04}
    \end{align}
    and this proves the claim.

3.  1. This grammar is not ambiguous.
    2. This grammar is not ambiguous.
    3. This grammar is ambiguous. Consider the string \\(\texttt{()()}\\). We show two leftmost derivations for it.
    \begin{align}
        S &\yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{()}S \yld \texttt{()}S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \drv \texttt{()()} \\\\
        S &\yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \drv \texttt{()()}
        \label{eq:020203-01}
    \end{align}
    \item This grammar is ambiguous. Consider the string \\(\texttt{ab}\\).
    We show two leftmost derivations for it.
    \begin{align}
        S &\yld \texttt{a}S\texttt{b}S \yld \texttt{ab}S \yld \texttt{ab}S \drv \texttt{abab} \\\\
        S &\yld \texttt{a}S\texttt{b}S \yld \texttt{ab}S\texttt{a}S\texttt{b}S \drv \texttt{abab}
        \label{eq:020203-02}
    \end{align}
    \item This grammar is ambiguous. Consider the string \\(\texttt{a+a+a}\\).
    We show two leftmost derivations for it.
    \begin{align}
        S &\yld S\texttt{+}S \yld S\texttt{+}S\texttt{+}S \drv \texttt{a+a+a} \\\\
        S &\yld S\texttt{+}S \yld \texttt{a+}S \yld \texttt{a+}S\texttt{+}S \drv \texttt{a+a+a}
        \label{eq:020203-03}
    \end{align}

4.  1. The grammar is 
    \begin{align}
        E &\yld E\ E\ op\ |\ num \\\\
        op &\yld \texttt{+}\ |\ \texttt{-}\ |\ \texttt{\*}\ |\ \texttt{/} 
        \label{eq:020204-01}
    \end{align}
    We prove that each string generated by this grammar is generated unambiguously by induction on the number of operations. For zero operations, the expression \\(E \yld num\\) is unambiguously generated. Suppose that all expressions with upto \\(k\\) operations are unambiguously generated. Then, any postfix operation with \\(k + 1\\) operations is of the form \\(E\_1\ E\_2\ op\\) where \\(E\_1\\) and \\(E\_2\\) are unambiguously generated postfix expressions with upto \\(k\\) operations. Thus, \\(E\\) is derived unambiguously as
    \begin{align}
        E \yld E\ E\ op \drv E\_1\ E\ op \drv E\_1\ E\_2\ op
        \label{eq:020204-02}
    \end{align}
    which proves the claim.

    2. The grammar is \\(L \yld L,\ id\ |\ id\\). We show that this grammar is unambiguous by induction on the number of identifiers. For one identifier, \\(L \yld id\\) is derived unambiguously. Consider a list \\(L = L\_1,\ id\\) of \\(k + 1\\) identifiers. We derive \\(L\\) as shown.
    \begin{align}
        L \yld L,\ id \drv L\_1,\ id
        \label{eq:020204-03}
    \end{align}
    which proves the claim.

    3. The grammar is \\(L \yld id,\ L\ |\ id\\). Proof is similar to the 
    left associative case.

    4. The grammar is
    \begin{align}
        E &\yld E\ \texttt{+}\ T\ |\ E\ \texttt{-}\ T\ |\ T \\\\
        T &\yld T\ \texttt{*}\ F\ |\ T\ \texttt{/}\ F\ |\ F \\\\
        F &\yld id\ |\ num\ |\ (E).
        \label{eq:020204-04}
    \end{align}
    We see that this grammar is unambiguous because of the fact that the 
    expression is built term by term from the rightmost end (represented 
    by \\(T\\)).

    5. The grammar is
    \begin{align}
        E &\yld E\ \texttt{+}\ T\ |\ E\ \texttt{-}\ T\ |\ T \\\\
        T &\yld T\ \texttt{*}\ U\ |\ T\ \texttt{/}\ U\ |\ U \\\\
        U &\yld \texttt{+}\ F\ |\ \texttt{-}\ F\ |\ F \\\\
        F &\yld id\ |\ num\ |\ (E).
        \label{eq:020204-05}
    \end{align}
    Proof of unambiguity is similar to the above exercise.
