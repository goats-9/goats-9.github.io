## Section 1.1: Language Processors

1. The differences between a compiler and interpreter are as follows.

| Compiler | Interpreter |
|-|-|
| It converts a program in a source language into an equivalent program in a target language. | It appears to directly execute the operations specified in the source code on inputs supplied by the user. |
| Faster runtime. | Slower runtime. |
| Lesser error diagnostics. | More error diagnostics. |

2. 
    1. The advantages of a compiler over an interpreter are as follows.
        * It produces target machine code that runs faster than an interpreter mapping inputs to outputs.
        * It secures the source program. Only the compiled executable is needed to run the program.
        * It generates more optimized code than the interpreter.
        * The compiled target code can be run on any other system with compatible architecture.
    2. The advantages of an interpreter over a compiler are as follows.
        * It has better error diagnostics than a compiler.
        * It is easier to debug with an interpreter than using a compiled executable.
        * Build times are faster than that of a compiler.
