1. Note that \\(\pr{C=c\ |\ M=m} = \pr{\textsf{Enc}\brak{m,K}=c}\\) depends on the distribution of keys in \\(\mathcal{K}\\). Let us redefine the key space to be the set of all random bits used by \\(\textsf{Gen}\\), and call this space of bitstrings \\(\mathcal{K'}\\). Then, each element of \\(\mathcal{K}\\) is uniformly distributed. Further, for any key \\(k\\),
\begin{equation}
\pr{K=k} = \pr{\textsf{Gen}\brak{K'}=k} = \frac{\abs{\cbrak{k'\in\mathcal{K'}:\textsf{Gen}\brak{k'}=k}}}{\abs{\mathcal{K}}}.
\label{eq:pr-K-K'}
\end{equation}
Note that
\begin{equation}
\pr{C=c\ |\ M=m} = \pr{\textsf{Enc}\brak{m,\ K} = c}.
\label{eq:pr-C-given-M}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq:pr-K-K'}, the probability distribution of \\(K\\) does not change, and hence by choosing the keyspace to be \\(\textsf{K'}\\), the value of \\(\pr{C=c\ |\ M=m}\\) does not change. Thus, we may assume without loss of generality that \\(\textsf{Gen}\\) picks a key from the key space uniformly at random.

2. Assume that \\(\textsf{Enc}\\) is not deterministic. Define the key space as in the previous problem and consider a new encryption algorithm \\(\textsf{Enc'}\brak{m, k, p} \triangleq \textsf{Enc}_p\brak{m, k}\\), where \\(p\\) is the set of random bits used by \\(\textsf{Enc}\\).
