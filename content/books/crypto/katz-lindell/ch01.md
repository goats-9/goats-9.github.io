2. The formal definitions for the algorithms in the context of the
   monoalphabetic substitution cipher are given below. Let the alphabet be
   \\(\Sigma = \cbrak{0,1,\ldots,25}\\). Here, the key space \\(\mathcal{K} =
   \Sigma\\), message and cipher spaces \\(\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{C} =
   \Sigma^+\\)
    - \\(\textsf{Gen}\\) is an algorithm that picks a permutation \\(\pi\brak{\mathcal{K}}\\) uniformly at random.
    - \\(\textsf{Enc}: \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \\) is a function defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \textsf{Enc}\brak{m\_1m\_2\ldots{}m\_n,\ k} = c\_1c\_2\ldots{}c\_n,\ \textrm{where } c\_i = \brak{m\_i + k\_i} \textrm{ mod } 26
    \label{eq:enc-def-sub}
    \end{equation}
    - \\(\textsf{Dec}: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{M} \\) is a function defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \textsf{Dec}\brak{c\_1c\_2\ldots{}c\_n,\ k} = m\_1m\_2\ldots{}m\_n,\ \textrm{where } m\_i = \brak{c\_i - k\_i} \textrm{ mod } 26
    \label{eq:dec-def-sub}
    \end{equation}
    
3. The formal definitions for the algorithms in the context of the Vigen&#232;re
   Cipher are given below. Denote the alphabet by \\(\Sigma =
   \cbrak{0,1,\ldots,25} \\).
    - \\(\textsf{Gen}\\) is an algorithm that picks a key \\(k =
      k\_0k\_1\ldots{}k\_{l-1}\\) of length \\(l\\) from \\(\Sigma^{+}\\)
      uniformly at random.
    - \\(\textsf{Enc} : \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}
    \\) is a function defined as 
    \begin{equation}
        \textsf{Enc}\brak{m\_0m\_1\ldots{}m\_{n-1},\ k} =
        c\_0c\_1\ldots{}c\_{n-1},\ \textrm{where } c\_i = \brak{m\_i + k\_{i
    \textrm{ mod } l}}\textrm{ mod } 26 
    \label{eq:enc-def-vig} 
    \end{equation}
    - \\(\textsf{Dec} : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
    \\) is a function defined as 
    \begin{equation}
        \textsf{Dec}\brak{c\_0c\_1\ldots{}c\_{n-1},\ k} =
        m\_0m\_1\ldots{}m\_{n-1},\ \textrm{where } m\_i = \brak{c\_i - k\_{i
    \textrm{ mod } l}}\textrm{ mod } 26 
    \label{eq:dec-def-vig} 
    \end{equation}

4. We can differentiate between a shift cipher and Vigen&#232;re Cipher with key
   of length greater than 1 by performing a frequency analysis on the
   ciphertext.

    Let \\(p_i\\) denote the probability of occurrence of the
    \\(i^{\text{th}}\\) letter on average in English texts, and let \\(q_i\\)
    denote the probability of occurrence of the \\(i^{\text{th}}\\) letter in
    the ciphertext. Define

    \begin{equation}
        S \triangleq \sum\_{i}p\_i^2
        \label{eq:S-def}
    \end{equation}

    and

    \begin{equation}
        I\_j \triangleq \sum_{i}p\_iq\_{i+j}
        \label{eq:Ij-def}
    \end{equation}

    where indices are taken modulo 26. If \\(I\_j = S\\) for some \\(0 \le j <
    26\\), then the shift cihper is used, otherwise the Vigen&#232;re Cipher
    with key length more than 1 is used.

    1. The formal definitions for each cipher are given below. Let \\(\Sigma =
       \cbrak{0,1}^8\\). Then, \\(\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{C} = \Sigma^*\\).
        1. **Shift Cipher**: The shift cipher is a cryptosystem
           \\(\Pi\left(\textsf{Gen}, \textsf{Enc}, \textsf{Dec}\right)\\), where
            - \\(\textsf{Gen}\\) is an algorithm that picks a binary string from
              \\(\mathcal{K} = \Sigma\\) uniformly at random.
            - \\(\textsf{Enc} : \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow
              \mathcal{C}\\) is a function defined as

            \begin{equation}
            \textsf{Enc}\brak{m\_1m\_2\ldots{}m\_n,\ k} = c\_1c\_2\ldots{}c\_n,\ \textrm{where } c\_i = m\_i \oplus k
            \label{eq:enc-def-shift}
            \end{equation}
            
            - \\(\textsf{Dec} : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow
              \mathcal{M}\\) is a function defined as

            \begin{equation}
            \textsf{Enc}\brak{c\_1c\_2\ldots{}c\_n,\ k} = m\_1m\_2\ldots{}m\_n,\ \textrm{where } m\_i = c\_i \oplus k
            \label{eq:dec-def-shift}
            \end{equation}

        2. **Vigen&#232;re Cipher**: The Vigen&#232;re Cipher is a cryptosystem
           \\(\Pi\brak{\textsf{Gen}, \textsf{Enc}, \textsf{Dec}}\\), where
            - \\(\textsf{Gen}\\) is an algorithm that picks a binary string from
              \\(\mathcal{K} = \Sigma^+\\) uniformly at random.
            - \\(\textsf{Enc} : \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow
              \mathcal{C}\\) is a function defined as

            \begin{equation}
            \textsf{Enc}\brak{m\_0m\_1\ldots{}m\_{n-1},\ k\_0k\_1\ldots{}k\_{l-1}} = c\_0c\_1\ldots{}c\_{n-1},\ \textrm{where } c\_i = m\_i \oplus k\_{i\textrm{ mod }l}
            \label{eq:enc-def-vigxor}
            \end{equation}
            
            - \\(\textsf{Dec} : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{K} \rightarrow
              \mathcal{M}\\) is a function defined as

            \begin{equation}
            \textsf{Dec}\brak{c\_0c\_1\ldots{}c\_{n-1},\ k\_0k\_1\ldots{}k\_{l-1}} = m\_0m\_1\ldots{}m\_{n-1},\ \textrm{where } m\_i = c\_i \oplus k\_{i\textrm{ mod }l}
            \label{eq:dec-def-vigxor}
            \end{equation}
    
    2.  We now have an alphabet of 256 symbols. The only modification to the
        attacks is that \\(p\_i\\) represents the probability of occurence of
        the \\(i^{\text{th}}\\) symbol.

7. Notice that, irregardless of the \\(p\_i,\ \sum\_{i}p\_i = 1\\). We do not
   gain additional information about the relative frequencies of the alphabet
   from this equality, unlike the quantity \\(\sum\_ip\_i^2\\).

8. We consider all ciphers one by one.
    - **Shift Cipher**: Knowing the ciphertext corresponding to any one message
      symbol gives us the key used.
    - **Substitution Cipher**: Knowing the ciphertext corresponding to all
      message symbols, which is essentially the key used.
    - **Vigen&#232;re Cipher**: We consider the plaintext `00...` for twice the
      length of the key. The resulting ciphertext is the key repeated twice. We
      require double the length to determine the length of the key and ensure we
      are not recovering part of the key.

9. The shift cipher preserves relative differences between letters. Here, the
   relative differences between the first and second letters of each of the two
   passwords is 1 and 3 respectively. Thus, by measuring the relative difference
   between the first and second letters, we can determine the plaintext.

10. - For a Vigen&#232;re Cipher of length 2, the differences between the
      \\(i^{\text{th}}\\) and \\(\brak{i+2}^{\text{th}}\\) letters for \\(i =
      1,2\\) are the same. Hence, using a Vigen&#232;re Cipher of length 2 is
      secure.
    - The difference between the first and last letters in the plaintexts is 3
      and 5 respectively. Since these two letters are going to be advanced by
      the same amount for a key of length 3, we can calculate the difference
      between them and determine the user's password.
    - For a Vigen&#232;re Cipher of length 4, this is the same as the One Time
      Pad (OTP).

11. The attack still remains valid, but the \\(p\_i's\\) and consequently
    \\(S\_{\tau}\\) will change.
