Using Git with SSH is now the go-to way of committing and pushing changes to a remote repository using version control. With many version control services like GitHub pulling support for HTTPS token-based authentication, it is imperative to switch to a more secure and convenient way of managing your repositories.

In this tutorial, we will have a look at creating a new SSH key and adding it to your GitHub account to manage your repositories remotely from your Linux system.

## Creating an SSH Key

1. Open up a terminal window.

2. At the terminal prompt, type
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<YOUR-EMAIL>"
    ```
    and press enter all the way through. An SSH private-public key pair will be generated by default at `$(HOME)/.ssh/id_ed2519[.pub]`.

    **Note**: If `ssh-keygen` is not found on your system, please install the `openssh` or equivalent package.

## Adding Your SSH Key to GitHub

1. Open up a browser window and go to [GitHub](https://github.com).

2. Login with your GitHub credentials and go to _Settings_, then under the _Access_ field, click on _SSH and GPG keys_.

3. Click on `New SSH key` at the top right of your screen.

4. Give a title to your new SSH key, and ensure that the type is `Authentication key`.
5. In a terminal window, issue the following command.
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
    This will print out the public key that you just generated.

    **Note**: Please do not expose your private key online.

6. Now, copy and paste the entire public key without extraneous characters to the _Key_ field.

7. Click on _Add SSH Key_ and follow the on-screen prompts to enable _Sudo mode_.

8. Your SSH key should be added and visible in _SSH and GPG keys_.

## Next Steps

**Note**: Skip this section if you have already set up `git` to recognize who you are.

1. Now that you have added your SSH key to your GitHub account, you have to set up `git` to recognize that you are committing.

2. At a terminal window, type the following commands.
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "<YOUR-NAME>"
    git config --global user.email "<YOUR-EMAIL>"
    ```

3. You can now commit and push changes to your remote repositories on GitHub!
